The laboratory was formed in Sep. 2019, and is led by Prof. Eunwoo Kim.  

The aim of Vision and Learning Laboratory at Chung-Ang University is to push the boundary of machine learning research by exploiting and developing efficient, versatile, and optimal machine learning models.
We engage in research to develop a model that understands and learns any intellectual task that human beings can do.

Our research interests include machine learning, deep learning, automated machine learning, multi-task learning, subspace learning, lifelong learning, and their applications to computer vision and robotics.
