<span style="font-family:Bebas Neue; font-size:1em;"># Vision and Learning Laboratory @ CAU</span>

The laboratory was formed in Sep. 2019 and is led by Prof. Eunwoo Kim.  

The aim of Vision and Learning Laboratory at Chung-Ang University is to push the boundary of machine learning research by exploiting and developing efficient, versatile, and optimal machine learning models, towards general-purpose artificial intelligence.
We engage in research to explore methods that understand and learn any intellectual task that human beings can do.

Our research interests include machine learning, deep learning, automated machine learning, multi-task learning, subspace learning, lifelong learning, and their applications to computer vision and robotics, but not limited to.


**Openings**     
VLLAB currently has a couple of open graduate student (M.S./Ph.D./M.S.-Ph.D. integrated) positions and a Postdoc position.       
VLLAB also has multiple open undergraduate intern positions every semester.       
Please contact Prof. Kim (eunwoo@cau.ac.kr) if you are interested in working with our group.
