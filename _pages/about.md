I am currently an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Engineering Science at University of Oxford and a member of [Torr Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/) working with Prof. [Philip H.S. Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~phst/). Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Seoul National University working with Prof. [Songhwai Oh](http://rllab.snu.ac.kr/people/songhwai-oh). I received the B.S. degree in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea in 2011, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees (under the supervision of Prof. Chong-Ho Choi and Prof. Songhwai Oh) in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Seoul National University, Korea in 2013 and 2017, respectively.
