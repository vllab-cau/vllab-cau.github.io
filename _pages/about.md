I am currently an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Engineering Science at University of Oxford and a member of Torr Vision Group working with Prof. Philip H.S. Torr. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Seoul National University working with Prof. Songhwai Oh. I received the B.S. degree in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea in 2011, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees (under the supervision of Prof. Chong-Ho Choi and Prof. Songhwai Oh) in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Seoul National University, Korea in 2013 and 2017, respectively.
