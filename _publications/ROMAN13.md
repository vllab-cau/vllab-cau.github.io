Abstract: There is a growing interest in smart homes and predicting behaviors of inhabitants is a key element for the success of smart home services. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, DBN-ANN and DBN-R, based on the deep learning framework for predicting various activities in a home. We also address drawbacks of contrastive divergence, a widely used learning method for restricted Boltzmann machines, and propose an efficient online learning algorithm based on bootstrapping. From experiments using home activity datasets, we show that our proposed prediction algorithms outperform existing methods, such as a nonlinear SVM and k-means, in terms of prediction accuracy of newly activated sensors. In particular, DBN-R shows an accuracy of 43.9% (51.8%) for predicting newly activated sensors based on MIT home dataset 1 (dataset 2), while previous work based on the n-gram algorithm has shown an accuracy of 39% (43%) on the same dataset.
